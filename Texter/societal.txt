<h1>Societal life during the enlightenment </h1>
<br>
<p>
During the 18th century, more and more people in European society learned to read. With this new skill came a new public interest: reading books. New printing machines would lead to newspapers and books being more widely available and distributed. This new group of literate, non-aristocratic citizens were the middle class, slowly emerging from poverty.
People of this era were not only reading more but also discussing the texts and current events. Philosophical and scientific discoveries were a big deal during this time and society would never be the same.
<br>
A new leisure interest, in England particularly, was the coffee houses in which people would discuss current topics while drinking coffee1.
European coffee houses were first established in Rome in 1645 but would quickly spread to England where it was an extremely popular drink until a few decades later, when tea became more liked by the public2.
<br>
This psychoactive drink played a significant role in the minds of people during the period. When people gathered to drink coffee instead of alcohol, like in the earlier drinking taverns, many new ideas could be made. These ideas eventually changed society to what we have today, with education for all, fairer democracy and separation between state and church.
<br>
However, these pleasures were not for the average man. Lower class people still spent most of their time making sure they could afford food for the day, some in the newly built factories around the time of the industrial revolution. Women were not included in these activities either as it was still believed that the middle- /and upper-class women should be in the house.
