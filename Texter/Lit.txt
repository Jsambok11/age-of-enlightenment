<h1> 18th century literature</h1>
     <h2>   Scientific interest </h2> <br>
<p>     The age of enlightenment- or the age of reason as it’s called- was a period of many scientific and philosophical discoveries. One of the biggest scientific books written at this time was “Principia”, which was written by well-known scientist Isaac Newton. “Principia” contains nearly all the essential concepts of physics and that’s why it was such an important book. The book gave more clarity and knowledge about the world to the people of the time.  </p>
     <h2>   Empirical learning  </h2><br>
<p>    Empirical learning was a method for more people to get more knowledge. Empirical learning is an idea that everything in our consciousness is obtained from everything we experienced. According to John Locke every human is being borned as a blank sheet of paper and does not have much knowledge but by using their sense they can gain knowledge.John Locke wrote his statements and thoughts about this in an essay on human understanding, but also he wrote about religious toleration and education.  </p>
<h2> Novels </h2> <br>
<p>       An immense number of novels were read in the 17th and 18th centuries and one main reason often given is that Great Britain was changing from being an agricultural country into an industrialized urbanised country. Libraries became a part of society and their importance was crucial for the distribution of literature nationwide. </p>
<h2>Satire and political writing</h2>    <br>
<p>  Some authors wrote with irony and satire to express their opinions. The authors used irony and satire to draw attention of the weakness of society like politics, religion or science. Authors wrote satires about politics, religion, science and society life. Main goal with satire was to reform and improve societal life. </p>
<h2>Steps to democracy   </h2> <br>
 <p>  During age of reason influence of monarchy was slowly decaying. Parliament become crucial and it gave some rights for people. Those rights were bad and writers like Jonathan Swift started to fight for liberty by writing satires. </p>  <br>
<p>  18th century was the beginning of the free speech in the europe. England introduced it and in theory it worked for everybody. Practically it worked only for wealthy people. Free speech was not also for atheist and only protestant and catholic could said what they wanted. <p>
<br>
<h2>Optimism and pessimism </h2>
<p>  Literature in this time was divided between optimism and pessimism. Authors like Daniel Defoe was one of the great authors of this time often in his work he wrote about optimism for humanity and believed that everyone had a good moral more that could be developed through art.Other authors, like Jonathan Swift, were showing the dark side of society. Pessimism came from science, politicians and philosophers. They wanted to not only understand the world but to make it better. </p>   <br>
    <p>  Novels were growing in popularity during the 18th century due to the invention of the book press. The most important books in this time were novels. </p>
<br>
<p>       C. Danny Defoe wrote many books, but his most read novel is Robinson Crusoe. The book depicts the Life and strange surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe. A quote from the book tells us more about the plot:  </p>
<br>
<p>  <i> “(he)who lived eight and twenty years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the coast of America, near the mouth of the great river of Oroonoque; having been cast on shore by shipwreck, wherein all the men perished but himself. With an account how, he was at last as strangely delivered by pirates. “ </i> </p> <br>
    <p>  The main messages in Robinson Crusoe are survival, covertness, spiritual growth and colonialism. When Crusoe gets to the island, he needs to do everything he can to survive. Later he begins to reflect on English society in the 18th century. He realises that humans are too closed to the world around them. People would, instead of being satisfied with that what god gave them be greedy and selfish. Crusoe later discovers that religion does not priests nor rituals but only strong faith, in line with the new wave of protestantism of the time.</p>   <br>
 <p>     Another notable thing is the spirit of British colonialism that manifests in the book. The Colonial mindset is shown in the way Crusoe treats his companion Friday, a indigenous man of color. Crusoe would be teaching him how to be more civilized, only to make him a servant.  </p>
