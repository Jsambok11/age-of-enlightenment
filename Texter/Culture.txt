<h1> Culture </h1>
<br>
<p>
During the age of enlightenment British culture was slowly evolving into culture we know today. Between 1660 and 1790 occurred many big changes in imperial England.
Thank to great British military that won almost very war they fought, culture could evolve in peace.
The biggest change was the introduction of coffee. Upper-/ and middle-class men started to meet each other in coffee houses, drink coffee and talk about politics. Universal suffrage, the right to vote, was a new revolutionary idea that came up during the end of the 18th century.
People could talk about politics and issues with it because of new laws that implicated freedom of speech for everyone.
<br>
Freedom of speech changed much. Catholic faith started to be little more acceptable which had large impact on culture. One of the most famous authors of the age of enlightenment, Alexander Pope was catholic. That Catholic were no longer persecuted did not meant that they was fully acceptable.
Freedom of speech wasn't also for everyone. After successful war with Spain British colonial empire gained more influence in slave trade.

Through 17th and 18th century the most fashionable part of clothing was a wig. Most of wigs for men was covered with white powder. Sometimes white powder were additional coloured. Pink, yellow and blue was most popular colours. Women often didnâ€™t wore wigs. They used coiffure to make hair look longer. Other notable thing in fashion in this times was widening of dresses.
<br>
Even the "poor people" like farmers or working class started to care about fashion. Of course not everybody cared how they looked but a major part of urban society did.
For example Voltaire during his trip to England, mistook servants and country people for "people of fashion" because they were dressed in their "best clothes" because of a fair that took place in city he visited.
When it comes to food it wasn't so good for ordinary people despite fact that agriculture became way more efficient. Meat was still a luxury and most people lived on mostly plant-based diets.
Important thing during this time was the growing popularity of tea in England.It quickly became the most popular drink after it was introduced from the British colonies.
<br>
Horse races have always been a big part of English culture. In the 18th century it finally became a professional sport, as to cricket also did. The first cricket club was formed in 1750 at Hambleton in Hamshire. Theaters were also important to British and European culture. Most towns had their own stage or assembly room. Assembly rooms were for people who played card and attended events such as balls/dances.
<br>
To summarise very briefly, during the age of enlightenment culture changed very slowly and the changes were minor
