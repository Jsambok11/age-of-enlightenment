<h1>Technology and science</h1>
<br>
<p>Did you know that the age of enlightenment is well known for all the science and technology? Well if you did not know that one of the many inventions of the age of enlightenment was the Watt steam engine, so this steam engine was the first practical and good engine that was developed by James Watt. So, this engine was the driving force to the industrial revolution. Why was this steam engine so good you may wonder well it was because of all the fuel it saved compared to all the previous steam engines before Watt´s engine was invented. Another great invention of this time was the steam locomotive which was created by George Stephenson. So, with the locomotive invented there was a new need for more railroads, so the locomotive could travel more distance. With more railroads you could use the locomotive to transport a larger number of items. So, having the locomotive railroads over the country helped with transportation and trade. More examples of inventions from the age of enlightenment are and these are just some of the many interesting inventions of this age.
•	1709 Bartolomeo Cristofori invents the piano.
•	1733 John Kay invents the flying shuttle.
•	1755 Alexander Cummings invents the flushing toilet.
The age of enlightenment was not only a time for inventions it was also a time for science. There were many great scientific people during this age which discovered many new things, one of them was Sir Isaac Newton, so who was Newton? Newton was a mathematician, astronomer and a scientist. So what Newton is famous for is the book he wrote called principia which contains Newton´s laws of motion, his law of universal gravitation and information on nearly all the essential concepts of physics. During the age of enlightenment, the solar system was truly discovered. Accurate calculations were made for orbits such as Halley’s comet and the first discovery of a planet since antiquity was made and it was Uranus. By using Newton´s theory of theory of the universal gravitation a calculation of the suns mass was done. Some other important people that discovered new things were.
•	Edmond Halley who discovered the proper motion of stars
•	Johannes Kepler with Kepler´s laws
•	Blaise Pascal contributed to mechanical calculators and the study about fluid and concept of pressure.

As you can see the age of enlightenment contributed to many technology and science aspects that we still have a use for today. </p>
