Women in the Enlightenment were very overlooked and there is not a lot of information to go on which is why it is debated. Women during the Enlightenment were not considered of equals to men, and much of their work and effort was suppressed because no one respected them.
The Enlightenment had many benefits such as to advance ideals of liberty, progress, and tolerance. Women were also given free speech which made it possible for them to discuss and set new goals, take part in political and social equality, and debate about religion.
England and France gave women much more freedom than the rest of Europe, the role of women in the Enlightenment were mostly for people in middle and upper class families because they had access to things like money to join societies and get an education to participate in debate which lower class women did not have. That makes it so that the women in the Enlightenment era could only be represented by a small amount of women who had privileges that most women didn’t.
There was very little incentive for change in these traditional gender roles during the early modern period. But during the Enlightenment, philosophers and writers in the Enlightenment started having ideas based on Science and Reality instead of depending on religion to have all the answers which helped change the traditional gender roles but it also went against the majority of people in the society.
There were many philosophers and writers who played a very important role in that era for example.
•	John Locke
•	David Hume
•	Adam Smith
•	Nicolas de Condorcet
•	and Jean-Jacques Rousseau
One of the most important women during that era was Alphra Behn because she was the first woman in Britain who supported herself by writing which was very hard since she was neglected in anthologies. She was also very important because she was unique, unafraid of expressing herself as an independent woman.
Before the Enlightenment era, men were considered superior to women. The rights of women were stripped away from them to help the men. The quality of the women’s education was very bad compared to the men. People thought that education was good for the society but Science was not for women.
