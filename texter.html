Technology and science
Did you know that the age of enlightenment is well known for all the science and technology? Well if you did not know that one of the many inventions of the age of enlightenment was the Watt steam engine, so this steam engine was the first practical and good engine that was developed by James Watt. So, this engine was the driving force to the industrial revolution. Why was this steam engine so good you may wonder well it was because of all the fuel it saved compared to all the previous steam engines before Watt´s engine was invented. Another great invention of this time was the steam locomotive which was created by George Stephenson. So, with the locomotive invented there was a new need for more railroads, so the locomotive could travel more distance. With more railroads you could use the locomotive to transport a larger number of items. So, having the locomotive railroads over the country helped with transportation and trade. More examples of inventions from the age of enlightenment are and these are just some of the many interesting inventions of this age.
•	1709 Bartolomeo Cristofori invents the piano.
•	1733 John Kay invents the flying shuttle.
•	1755 Alexander Cummings invents the flushing toilet.
The age of enlightenment was not only a time for inventions it was also a time for science. There were many great scientific people during this age which discovered many new things, one of them was Sir Isaac Newton, so who was Newton? Newton was a mathematician, astronomer and a scientist. So what Newton is famous for is the book he wrote called principia which contains Newton´s laws of motion, his law of universal gravitation and information on nearly all the essential concepts of physics. During the age of enlightenment, the solar system was truly discovered. Accurate calculations were made for orbits such as Halley’s comet and the first discovery of a planet since antiquity was made and it was Uranus. By using Newton´s theory of theory of the universal gravitation a calculation of the suns mass was done. Some other important people that discovered new things were.
•	Edmond Halley who discovered the proper motion of stars
•	Johannes Kepler with Kepler´s laws
•	Blaise Pascal contributed to mechanical calculators and the study about fluid and concept of pressure.

As you can see the age of enlightenment contributed to many technology and science aspects that we still have a use for today.

  Religion and Superstition
The Age of Enlightenment refers to the 18th century in European philosophy and is often studied part of a larger age that also includes the age of rationality. The term refers to the evolution of a historical cultural movement called Enlightenment which defended rationality and its principles as means to establish the legal system of ethics and knowledge instead of religion. The pioneers of this movement considered their mission is to lead the world to development and modernization and to leave old religious and cultural traditions and irrational ideas within a period of time they called "The Dark Ages".

Those who think that the Age of Enlightenment would mean infidelity, atheism, or total abandonment of religion are mistaken. On the contrary, it basically meant the setting of a new conception of religion, and this perception setting differs from the fundamentalist perception that prevailed throughout the middle Ages.
Until the end of the 17th century the European people lived under the old fundamentalist system and anyone does not follow the principles of Orthodoxy would expose himself to strict punishment. But there were signs of change by the advent of the 18th century, or even shortly before and the threats against the old religion were increasing more and more.

Church authorities were no longer able to control the situation despite the support of the political authorities. Christian Orthodoxy started receding slowly in favour of the new ideas during the Age of Enlightenment. Both Christianity and the religious problem was the course of philosophy in the eighteenth century as a whole and the relationship with God was the basis of thought. All philosophers and thinkers were talking about this problem and trying to solve it.

They blame some fossilized versions of Christianity by philosophers did not mean that they were unbelievers or anti-religionists. Philosophers were condemning the conversion of Christianity to a tool used by clerics to exploit people and to broadcast paganism and superstition in their midst. For this reason, the politicians accused these philosophers of atheism. The battle was fiercely fought between the two parties, the fundamentalist party represented by the politicians and the rational party represented by the philosophers and thinkers.

The philosophy of enlightenment has given its confidence to the man and his potential and ability to change the reality and improve it for the better. This is how the philosophers of Enlightenment depicted a bright future in a world dominated by man, in which paradise is achieved on this earth and through this progress they were able to win the battle against fundamentalism.
