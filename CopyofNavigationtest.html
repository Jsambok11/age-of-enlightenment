      Age of enlightenment is known for new technologies and changes in economy. Free trade allowed private companies (like British East India Company) to develop better international trade. Private companies often had granted monopoly on trade, for example British East India Company had monopoly on trade in East India.
 Countries and continents were connected to each other by many new economic ties.
Because of big changes in trade also other aspect of economy changed.
The huge production of luxury goods in countries like china or even India was very important hallmark of economics on a global scale. Free global trade changed much more than economics. Since changes in trade were huge, new political ideas was introduced and new laws was implemented.
Slave trade become also more efficient thank to free trade doctrine, so the idea of slave trade was developed by the Muslims, African leaders liked the idea  of slave trading because they saw a good chance to make profit of this. So the process of the slave trade was that they would kidnap Africans to be able to sell them to more powerful countries like The Great Britain and they would use them for slave market and the profit from this was huge so that’s why it kept going and using slaves was also efficient it .Helped increase the mass production of food and other goods. . Today we think that half of slave trade from Africa accrued in 18th century. The most important countries in slave trade was France, England and Portugal. Main source of slaves in this time was Angola.
Agriculture before age of enlightenment was very inefficient compared to this at the end of 18th century. With invention of horse drawn hoe fields could become bigger. The very old three-field system was replaced with far better system. They began to grow vegetables like rutabaga and turnips on a field instead of leaving it free. for one season. Most of England didn’t heard about it and still used this old system. In three-field system all the land around a village or small town, was divided into 3 huge fields. 2 out of 3 fields were planted with grain. One was left alone for one year because amount of natural fertilizer like nitrogen in the ground was limited.
In conclusion the age of enlightenment brought us very important changes in economy that made able to raise up in the economic latter.

      Religion and Superstition
    The Age of Enlightenment refers to the 18th century in European philosophy and is often studied part of a larger age that also includes the age of rationality. The term refers to the evolution of a historical cultural movement called Enlightenment which defended rationality and its principles as means to establish the legal system of ethics and knowledge instead of religion. The pioneers of this movement considered their mission is to lead the world to development and modernization and to leave old religious and cultural traditions and irrational ideas within a period of time they called "The Dark Ages".

    Those who think that the Age of Enlightenment would mean infidelity, atheism, or total abandonment of religion are mistaken. On the contrary, it basically meant the setting of a new conception of religion, and this perception setting differs from the fundamentalist perception that prevailed throughout the middle Ages.
    Until the end of the 17th century the European people lived under the old fundamentalist system and anyone does not follow the principles of Orthodoxy would expose himself to strict punishment. But there were signs of change by the advent of the 18th century, or even shortly before and the threats against the old religion were increasing more and more.

    Church authorities were no longer able to control the situation despite the support of the political authorities. Christian Orthodoxy started receding slowly in favour of the new ideas during the Age of Enlightenment. Both Christianity and the religious problem was the course of philosophy in the eighteenth century as a whole and the relationship with God was the basis of thought. All philosophers and thinkers were talking about this problem and trying to solve it.

    They blame some fossilized versions of Christianity by philosophers did not mean that they were unbelievers or anti-religionists. Philosophers were condemning the conversion of Christianity to a tool used by clerics to exploit people and to broadcast paganism and superstition in their midst. For this reason, the politicians accused these philosophers of atheism. The battle was fiercely fought between the two parties, the fundamentalist party represented by the politicians and the rational party represented by the philosophers and thinkers.

    The philosophy of enlightenment has given its confidence to the man and his potential and ability to change the reality and improve it for the better. This is how the philosophers of Enlightenment depicted a bright future in a world dominated by man, in which paradise is achieved on this earth and through this progress they were able to win the battle against fundamentalism.
