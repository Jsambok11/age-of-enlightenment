      Age of enlightenment is known for new technologies and changes in economy. Free trade allowed private companies (like British East India Company) to develop better international trade. Private companies often had granted monopoly on trade, for example British East India Company had monopoly on trade in East India.
 Countries and continents were connected to each other by many new economic ties.
Because of big changes in trade also other aspect of economy changed.
The huge production of luxury goods in countries like china or even India was very important hallmark of economics on a global scale. Free global trade changed much more than economics. Since changes in trade were huge, new political ideas was introduced and new laws was implemented.
Slave trade become also more efficient thank to free trade doctrine, so the idea of slave trade was developed by the Muslims, African leaders liked the idea  of slave trading because they saw a good chance to make profit of this. So the process of the slave trade was that they would kidnap Africans to be able to sell them to more powerful countries like The Great Britain and they would use them for slave market and the profit from this was huge so that’s why it kept going and using slaves was also efficient it .Helped increase the mass production of food and other goods. . Today we think that half of slave trade from Africa accrued in 18th century. The most important countries in slave trade was France, England and Portugal. Main source of slaves in this time was Angola.
Agriculture before age of enlightenment was very inefficient compared to this at the end of 18th century. With invention of horse drawn hoe fields could become bigger. The very old three-field system was replaced with far better system. They began to grow vegetables like rutabaga and turnips on a field instead of leaving it free. for one season. Most of England didn’t heard about it and still used this old system. In three-field system all the land around a village or small town, was divided into 3 huge fields. 2 out of 3 fields were planted with grain. One was left alone for one year because amount of natural fertilizer like nitrogen in the ground was limited.
In conclusion the age of enlightenment brought us very important changes in economy that made able to raise up in the economic latter.
